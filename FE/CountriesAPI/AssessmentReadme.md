To get started, ensure you install all dependencies. From the root of the project (CountriesAPI), run npm install, then npm run dev. This will provide you with the link: http://localhost:5173.

Make sure you have the backend project running first; otherwise, it won't work.

Some countries may not match due to variations in their names. For example, "Venezuela" may appear as "Venezuela, RB" in the population link, leading to mismatches.
